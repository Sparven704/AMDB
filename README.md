# AMDB

A quick web application created in react built to communicate with the API I have previously built as a assignment for Chas Academy.

## Structure

When you launch the app you are greeted with all the users I get from the API. When you click a users card you then go to their profile page where you see all their liked genres, and movies they have added. 
On this page you can both add a new liked genre and also add more movies you have watched.

There is another page called Top Movies where I show all current top movies taken from the TMDB API.
